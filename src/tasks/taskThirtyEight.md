## Objective of Task
Task 38 focuses on overviewing and encouraging the development and deployment of e-Ships, by building and sharing key knowledge on projects, performance, segments and demand. 

Fully electric ships is a new and emerging technology tailwinded by the substantial reductions in battery and renewable electricity production costs. Electric maritime propulsion also supports direct use of renewable energy, significant improvements in energy efficiency and zero emission transport. 

With the Paris Agreement, nations have agreed to keep the global mean temperature rise to be well below 2oC by 2100. Shipping industry is one of the large carbon emitters. As the demand for shipping is continuously growing, there is a great need for low and zero carbon shipping.  

The focus of the task will primarily be on battery electric ships, but will include related and relevant topics including hybrid battery electric systems, electric retrofit readiness for new ships and capabilities synergy between electric and autonomous ships. 

The first phase of Task 38 will be to overview e-ships projects, policies and potential deployment in Scandinavia and Europe, where many new electric projects are being built. The second phase will include the Americas and the third phase will overview Asia and the rest of the world. There will be a cross cutting focus on e-ships on islands. A country and stakeholder workshop will be held in each of the regions. 

Examples of cases and different segments of e-ships in the European region are described very briefly below. The working method of Task 38, the benefits of participating and how to join the Task is also described.  

## working method
Task 38 on e-Ships concentrates on the following objectives: 

1. Provide a leading network and platform on e-Ships for policymakers, researchers and industry bridging ’blue’ maritime, ’green’ energy, e-mobility including energy system, charging and automation perspectives 
2. Document international e-Ships success cases in a common format 
3. Overview, characterize and showcase technology, economics, policies, energy and environmental aspects, applications and market potentials 
4. Look for segmentation, convergence and scaling of supply and demand 
5. Analyze and document the current and future perspectives for e-Ships 
6. Develop methods for data collection and key figures for modelling, for EU Directive on Infrastructure, for IEA, EVI etc. 
7. Concentrate knowledge and data into policy relevant information to advance adoption and market acceptance of e-Ships
