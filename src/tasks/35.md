## Objective of Task
Task 35 "Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles of the IEA TCP Hybrid and Electric Vehicles" (HEV) aims at supporting a broader commercialization, acceptance and a further development of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCVs) by collecting and sharing pre-competitive information, exchange about framing conditions, best practices and ideas, how to develop the market conditions and mobility concepts further. 

Task 35 looks at light duty EVs for passenger transport which are either classified as L category vehicles, Kei cars, Micro- or subcompact FCVs. 

The main approach of Task 35 is to collect and exchange information, opinions and concerns in workshops and to disseminate the results amongst stakeholders and policymakers. Three major topics are distinguished: 
- FCVs concepts: Technologies, prospects and research needs. - Hydrogen station for FCVs concepts: Technologies, prospects and research needs - Market condition for FCVs and hydrogen station: international differences and best practices 

## working method
The main approach of Task 35 is to collect and exchange information, opinions and concerns in workshops and to disseminate the results amongst stakeholders and policymakers. Three major topics are distinguished: 

- FCVs concepts: technologies, prospects and research needs. 
- Hydrogen station for FCVs concepts: Technologies, prospects and research needs. 
- Market condition for FCVs and hydrogen station: international differences and best practices.  

The workshops aim to attract professionals from research, enterprises and policy makers, depending on the individual topics. An international survey distributed to a wider audience complements the workshops. Major insights and results together with other findings from desktop research will be published at conferences and in scientific journals. 

Utilising the existing HEV TCP framework, Task 35 will answer the main key questions related to FCVs research and development, e.g.: 

- What technologies are available to improve FCVs, their efficiency, range, comfort and how to lower their costs? 
- What barriers exist for bringing more FCVs to the market? 
- What safety concepts for FCVs exist, how efficient are they and where are options for improvement? 
- Safety for hydrogen stations.  

The results of the Task are to be shared with the public, as agreed with the workshop participants. Literature citations of a company’s representative may be excluded by mutual agreement. The presentations and discussions within the workshops are shared by the participants. Publications about the Task and about results are in the interest of the participating researchers. The papers and presentations will exclude confidential and/or non-official statements. A final report summarising the overall results of the Task will be prepared by the operating agents with the contributions from the Task partners.
