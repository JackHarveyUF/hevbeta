## Objective of Task
Task 1 serves as a platform for information exchange among member countries. The objectives are to collect, analyse, and disseminate information on hybrid, electric and fuel cell vehicles, and related activities.  
Information exchange focuses on these topics: 
- Research and technology development; 
- Commercialization, marketing, sales, and procurement
- Regulation, standards, and policies; 
- Awareness raising measures; and 
- Activities of HEV TCP Tasks. 

## working method
Experts from member countries serve as delegates at Task 1 meetings held every six months in conjunction with the HEV TCP Executive Committee (ExCo) meetings. Country delegates also write country-specific information for HEV TCP publications, such as the country chapters in this annual report. Many country delegates also serve dual roles as the official Operating Agent (OA) for a specific Task. In this role, they may also represent HEV TCP to a public audience by presenting Task results at international conferences, such as the EVS (Electric Vehicle Symposium) meetings.  

The Task 1 OA is responsible for coordinating and leading the biannual experts’ meetings, compiling the minutes of these meetings, maintaining the HEV TCP website, and editing and supervising the production of the newsletter and the ExCo annual report. The OA also acts as liaison to the other Task OAs, the ExCo Chair (together with the Secretary-General), and the IEA Desk Officer. Since the start of 2020, the responsibility for Task 1 has been transferred to Kate Palmer of Urban Foresight (United Kingdom) as the OA.  

A significant component of the information exchange for the Task occurs at the experts’ meetings, where participants brief the attendees on relevant reports, facts, and statistics pertaining to hybrid and electric vehicles in their home countries. These presentations generally cover current developments on the market situations for EVs and HEVs (national sales and fleet penetration, by vehicle type); the progress of international, national, or local programs and incentives in the field; and new initiatives in vehicle and component development arising from both the private sector and public-private partnerships.  

Al member countries of the HEV TCP automatically participate in Task 1. There is no cost for Task membership. Each country designates an agency or nongovernmental organization as its Task 1 expert delegate. Frequently, guest experts are invited to participate in Task 1 meetings to present their activities and to exchange experiences with HEV TCP participants. This is a valuable source for keeping up to date with worldwide developments.         

## Results
Notable events in 2020 included the following: 
- The first virtual Task 1 Information Exchange meetings in October 2019. 
- The HEV TCP Annual Report titled “The Electric Scales Up” was published in 2020.  

With the OA responsibility for Task 1 moving to Urban Foresight at the start to 2020, there are some aspects of the running of communications which have changed. 
- The internal members-only website was migrated to a new platform for increased functionality. 
- The external-facing website is being redeveloped. The aim of the project will be to modernise and improve the current HEV TCP website, including its accessibility, ease of maintenance and user experience. This will constitute rebuilding and restructuring the current website, which will be facilitated by Urban Foresight and the assistance of a web development contractor. 
- The biannual HEV TCP Newsletter is reinstated. The first issue was released in December 2020. We welcome any contributions from HEV TCP members in forthcoming issues.  

Talks have started regarding the organisation of the HEV TCP ExCo meeting in Dundee (Scotland) in November 2021.
