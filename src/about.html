                <h4>Who is the HEV TCP?</h4>
                <p>The Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Technology Collaboration Program (HEV TCP) enables member parties to discuss their respective needs, share key information, and learn from an ever-growing pool of experience from the development and deployment of hybrid and electric vehicles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The HEV TCP was formed in 1993 to produce and disseminate balanced, objective information about advanced electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. It is an international membership group collaborating under the International Energy Agency (IEA) framework. TCPs are at the core of the IEA International Technology Co-operation Programme coordinated by the IEA Committee on Energy Research and Technology (CERT). HEV TCP is now in its sixth five-year term of operation that runs from March 2020 until March 2025. An annual report is published each year which details work completed under the HEV TCP and news from member countries. 
                </p>
                <h4>Membership to the HEV TCP </h4>
                <p>The HEV TCP offers two types of membership: Contracting Parties and Sponsors. Members designate a representative to serve on the Executive Committee that provides overall direction, approves the budget, and formulates policy and strategy. The HEV TCP’s primary work is conducted through Tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 18 active Contracting Parties (member countries) as of May 2021 are Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States.
                </p>
                <h4>Governance and management </h4>
                <p>The work of HEV TCP is governed by the Executive Committee (“ExCo”), which consists of one member designated by each Contracting Party. Contracting Parties are either governments of IEA countries or parties designated by their respective governments. The HEV TCP ExCo meets twice a year to discuss and plan the working programme.  
                </p>
                <h4>Tasks</h4>
                <p>The actual work of the HEV TCP is achieved through a variety of different Tasks that are focused on specific topics. Each topic is addressed in a Task, which is managed by an Operating Agent (OA) – before 2011 these task forces were called Annexes. The work plan of a new Task is prepared by an interim OA, either on the OA’s own initiative or on request of the ExCo, and the work plan is then submitted for approval to the HEV TCP ExCo. To date, 35 tasks have been completed, and 10 tasks are ongoing.
